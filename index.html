                        Hello and welcome. My name is Joe Gelsomini, and I am an aspiring software engineer with a BS in Computer 
                        Science with a Math minor from the University of Massachusetts Lowell. I've had an interest in computers from 
                        a young age which naturally drew me to explore Computer Science in college. One thing I always enjoyed about the 
                        field is the creative aspect to it. Tackling challenges can be frustrating, but the open ended nature of many problems
                        makes it satisfying to experiment and explore possibilities. The creativity behind the problem solving process is 
                        rewarding, and this is also true in the design process, which I got to explore more in the development of this web page.

                            <br>Implementation of the Evil Hangman algorithm in the C language. This was the semster long project for 
                            UMass Lowell's Computing II class, which served as an introduction to data structures. All files available
                             to play the game are on Github.  The game internally reads in a large text file of words. Then after 
                             recieving the desired word length from the player as well as desired number of turns, the algorithm 
                             reads in guesses from the player and eliminates all possible words that would fit that potential guess. 
                             Managing of words is done with an AVL tree. An easy way to win is to ask for 26 guesses and guess every 
                             letter in the alphabet!

                           Implementation of the Big Integer class in the C++ language. The class features the ability to construct
                           class instances via standard C++ integer parameters, or a completely numeric string. The Big Integer class was designed to 
                           behave as the standard integer class, but with the ability to store much larger integer values. A standard string is used 
                           internally as a representation for the integer, which meant that the standard integer operations had to be reimplemented 
                           from scratch. This project was created for UMass Lowell's Computing III course.

                        <p><br>
                           Ants and Doodlebugs was another project from UMass Lowell's Computing III course. This simple simulation displays a series of time steps 
                           representing the interactions of two different species. Ants are represented as green 'O's while the Doodlebugs are the red 'X's. The different
                           critters move about the board in a random manner and perodically repopulate, but whenever the doodlebugs sense an ant in an adjacent tile, they 
                           move onto the tile occupied by the ant, consuming it. If the Doodlebugs go more than 3 time steps without eating, they will die, which is 
                           represented by them vanishing from the board. The populations of the critters follow a cyclic pattern. This project also demonstrates polymorphism, 
                           as each creature is derived from a basic tile class, and implement movement differently.

                        <p><br>
                           A C++ program that generates and displays a pythagroas tree. The Pythagoras tree class (pTree)
                           derives from the drawable class from the SFML library. The command arguments that the program accepts are recursion depth and
                           length of the base square. Given a length L, the entire tree fits snugly inside a window with dimensions <i>6L × 4L</i>. The tree is 
                           generated recursively. With each call to the geneartion function, the base of the current branch is drawn, then the left and right 
                           branch of that square gets generated and drawn until the recursion depth reaches zero. This project was completed for UMass Lowell's 
                           Computing IV class.

                           Trained a Recurrent Neural Network to classify article headlines into 8 different possible categories. The dataset used was a subset taken from Kaggle's

                           implemented using Pytorch's torch.nn.Module class and acheives a test accuracy of 74%. This was an assignment completed in Jupyter Notebook for 
                           UMass Lowell's Natural Language Processing class.
