                        <p>
                            I'm Joe Gelsomini, a Computer Science graduate from the University of 
                            Massachusetts, Lowell. My current role is a Cybersecurity Engineer for Werfen 
                            North America.

                            Over the past three years at Werfen, I have focused on creating automated security 
                            solutions intended for our medical devices located in hospital laboratories across 
                            the world.
                            
                            I've helped streamline device maintenance by replacing complex manual patching 
                            processes with automated installers. My tools have become the standard approach for 
                            applying cybersecurity patches and fixes to our products in the field.
                            
                            Most notably, my solutions have been recognized to reduce instrument down time 
                            during device maintenance by 60%.
                            
                            My efforts have been recognized to positively impact device security, patient safety, 
                            and compliance with international health standards within my organization.

                            One of the most gratifying aspects of my career has been the oppurtunity to 
                            use the techinical skills I gained in college to provide a real world impact. 
                            Going forward in my career, I want to continue to create solutions that positively
                            impact the lives and jobs of others, while also continuing to develop my technical 
                            knowlege and experience. I have the ability to work as an individual, and as part 
                            of a team. During my time at Werfen, I have had oppurtunities to work with other Cybersecurity
                            engineers on my team, as well as other roles outside of my department, including field 
                            service managers and systems engineers. I am most interested in pursuing roles related to 
                            Software engineering and Cybersecurity, with a strong team dynamic, and oppurtunities to work
                            with engineers in other disciplines.

                            Technology plays a large role in my life, and I do my best to balance that with other interests. 
                            I enjoy going on bike trails and nature walks. I am not a professional phtographer, but I 
                            love to capture what sticks out to me, whether it is beautiful scenery, wildlife, or interesting plants 
                            or fungi. A favorite creative outlet of mine is cooking, but I am always willing to try and learn new things.

                            <br>Implementation of the Evil Hangman algorithm in the C language. This was the semester long project for 
                            UMass Lowell's Computing II class, which served as an introduction to data structures. All files available
                             to play the game are on Github.  The game internally reads in a large text file of words. Then after 
                             recieving the desired word length from the player as well as desired number of turns, the algorithm 
                             reads in guesses from the player and eliminates all possible words that would fit that potential guess. 
                             Managing of words is done with an AVL tree. An easy way to win is to ask for 26 guesses and guess every 
                             letter in the alphabet!

                           Implementation of the Big Integer class in the C++ language. The class features the ability to construct
                           class instances via standard C++ integer parameters, or a completely numeric string. The Big Integer class was designed to 
                           behave as the standard integer class, but with the ability to store much larger integer values. A standard string is used 
                           internally as a representation for the integer, which meant that the standard integer operations had to be reimplemented 
                           from scratch. This project was created for UMass Lowell's Computing III course.

                        <p><br>
                           Ants and Doodlebugs was another project from UMass Lowell's Computing III course. This simple simulation displays a series of time steps 
                           representing the interactions of two different species. Ants are represented as green 'O's while the Doodlebugs are the red 'X's. The different
                           critters move about the board in a random manner and perodically repopulate, but whenever the doodlebugs sense an ant in an adjacent tile, they 
                           move onto the tile occupied by the ant, consuming it. If the Doodlebugs go more than 3 time steps without eating, they will die, which is 
                           represented by them vanishing from the board. The populations of the critters follow a cyclic pattern. This project also demonstrates polymorphism, 
                           as each creature is derived from a basic tile class, and implement movement differently.

                        <p><br>
                           A C++ program that generates and displays a pythagroas tree. The Pythagoras tree class (pTree)
                           derives from the drawable class from the SFML library. The command arguments that the program accepts are recursion depth and
                           length of the base square. Given a length L, the entire tree fits snugly inside a window with dimensions <i>6L × 4L</i>. The tree is 
                           generated recursively. With each call to the geneartion function, the base of the current branch is drawn, then the left and right 
                           branch of that square gets generated and drawn until the recursion depth reaches zero. This project was completed for UMass Lowell's 
                           Computing IV class.

                           One of the items I choose to show off in my portfolio is the portfolio itself, quite meta isn't it? This is a personal project with the purpose of giving myself more
                           experience in front end web development with html and css. It also has the added benefit of being able to grow alongside myself,
                           as I gain more relevant skills and experience to show off here in the future. Thanks for checking it out, and I hope you enjoyed the background picture of the Giant's 
                           Causeway in Ireland, which was taken by myself on a family trip some time in the Summer of 2018.

                           It's Flappy Bird! I can't take full credit for this however, as I heavily followed a tutorial published by Javidx9, a programmer/ YouTuber who I've been following
                           after gaining interest in his C++ header files he's published to serve as simple game engines. This servers as my introduction to his olcConsoleGameEngine, and I can
                           see myself using it in the future to create other simple little games. In my implementation of this game, the players score is increased when passing through a door. 
                           There are also the red doors, which will flip gravity until another red door is passed. It's a simple feature but does add a greater challenge in my opinion.                       </p>

                            <br>kdbx-merge is a Python script I developed to merge two KeePassXC databases into a single database.
                            It ensures all entries are retained with their attributes intact and checks for conflicts to avoid data corruption.
                            This tool helps keep my personal password vaults synchronized across different storage locations.
